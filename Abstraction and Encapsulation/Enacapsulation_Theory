ENCAPSULATION:
It is a concept of OOP
-> Encapsulation is a process of binding the properties and behaviour of an object together.
-> It restrict direct access of data
-> Rather than giving direct access to the data it will give indirect secured access.
-> Before modifying any data will verify and validate
-> With the help of Encapsulation we can achieve data hiding.
-> It also provde security to ths data.

PRO'S:
1. Data Hiding: The internal data of an object is hidden from the outside world, preventing direct access of data.
2. Data Integrity: Only validated value can be assigned to an objects attribute. (With the help of setter method)
3. Reusability: We can reuse the data for further modification.
4. Security: Sensitive data is protected as it can not be accessed directly.


** we can achieve encapsualtion with the help of private properties and using public method(which is getter and setter method)

1. PRIVATE: It is a keyword
we will prefix varaibles with the private keyword(Private variable)
and we can't access private data

2. Getter() method: It is used to fetch private data outside the class.
-> return type will be any specific data
-> getter() method will be non-parametertized method.

3. Setter() method: for the set data or update the data outside the class.
-> return the type of setter method will be void 
-> It is a parameterized method.
