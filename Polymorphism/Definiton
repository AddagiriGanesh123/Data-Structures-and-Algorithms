Polymorphism: Anything in java which can perform more than one task at a time, we will call is as polymorphism.
Polymorphism is a Greek Word.
-> Poly : Many
-> Morphism: Forms

There are two types of Polymorphism:-
1) Compile time Polymorphism:- It is a type of Polymorphism, in which the binding will be achieved at compile time.

-> Method Overloading: It is a class will have more than one method with the same name and different parameters, we will call it as Meyhod Overloading.
Uses:
1. Code Reusability,
2. It will make code efficient.

2) Constructor Overloading: It is a class will have more than one constructor with same name and several parameters.

3) Variable Shadowing: If a parent class and child class both will have same variable either static or non-static we will call it as Variable shadowing.
-> Priority will be given to parent class

4) Method Shadowing: If a parent class and child class both will have same static method the priority will be given to the parent class method.
-> It is called method shadowing.
