Sorting: Converting the order of elements in either Ascdending order or Descending Order
BUBBLE SORT:
Space Complexity : O(1)-> Linear
i.e., No duplication of code, copying array into another array

Time Complexity:
O(n)-> For best case (If the elements are not swapped case)
Ex: If we have 5 elements in the array then 5 times the array is checked

O(n^2)-> For worst case ( If the elements are swapped case)
Ex: If we have 5 elements in the array then [5 * 5 = 25] times the array is checked
