// The key difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in Java lies in their thread safety. 
// StringBuilder is more efficient then String Buffer
// StringBuffer is synchronized, meaning it's thread-safe, while StringBuilder is not, 
// making it faster for single-threaded operations. 
// StringBuffer was introduced earlier in Java 1.0, whereas StringBuilder was added in Java 1.5

Java.lang.class of String is In-Built method
