class in java: object class is the super most class in Java.
-> it is the parent class for all classes in java.
-> It will have some built-in methods.
1.TOSTRING() METHOD
2.EQUALS()
3. HASHCODE() METHOD

1. ToString() : this method will usede to return the address of a given object in string fromat or hexadecimal format.
-> Evey object will have some addresses.
-> return type is String.

2. equlas() method: it is used to compare two objects.
like == operator
-> It will compare the adderess of the object
-> return type is boolean

3. hashcode() : It is used to generate some unique id or number for every.
-> It will generate hash number which is used in hashing.
-> return type int data-type

*****Overriding of toString(), equals(), hashcode():-
1. After overriding toString() it will return not the address of  object but properties of object.

2. After overriding equals() method it will compare properties of an object not the addresses of object

3. After overridinf hashcode() method it will generate unique number based on properties not on object reference.
