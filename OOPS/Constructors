Constructors:
Constructor is a component of a class in Java.
Constructor can't have return type.
Constructor is used to initialise the object
In a class it is compulsory to have a Constructor
In a class we can have more than one constructor
Tpes of Constructors:
1) Default Constructor: Default Constructor is the Constructor which is created by the compiler implicitly in class.

2) User-Defined Constructor: User-Defined Constructor is a Constructor, is created by the programmer explicitly in class.
we have two types for User-Defined Constructor:-
1) Parameterised constructor: If we are passing any parameters in the constructor we will call it as Parameterised constructor
2) Non-Parameterised constructor : If we are not passing any parameters in the constructor we will call it as Non-Parameterised constructor

Syntax for the Constructor:
access_modifier ClassName(){
//statement
}

Note:- In a class we can not have duplicate constructor
-> Some places default constructor and non-parametrised constructor considers as same
