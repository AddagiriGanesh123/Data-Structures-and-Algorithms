Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor.
Why we use?
-> When we want to perform multiple tasks in a single constructor raather than creating a code for each task, single constructor has separate constructor
   to each task which makes readaable and reliable.

It can be done two ways:
1) Within the class: by using this() keyword for constructors in the same class
2) From Base Class: by using super() keyword to call constructor from the base class

Rules for Constructor chaining within the same class:
-> the this() expression should always be the first line of the constructor.
-> There should be at-least one constructor with-out this() keyword.
-> Constructor chaining can be aachieved in any order.
