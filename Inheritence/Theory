Inherietnce : it is an OOP principle
-> If one class is trying to acquire the properties and behaviour from another class, we will call it as Inherietnce
-> For Inherietnce it-is-a Relationship is required.
Which is called as super class and sub class

1.parent Class: the class will give properties and behaviour to another class, we will call it as Parent class.
2.Child class: the calss wil take properties from another classs, it is called a child calass

-> we can achieve inheritence in java with the help of extends keyword.

Advantages:
1) Code Resuabilty: Inherited member from super class, can be used in sub class
2) Hierachial organization: Inherietnce provides well structured hierarchies which will improve readability and maintainence of code.
3) It will help in method overRiding
4) It will help in easier maintaince

Types:
1) Single Inhertence: It is a type of Inherietnce, in which one level of realtionship will be there. (one parent class, one child class)
Ex: Father-Son

2) Muilti level Inheritence: It is a type of Inherietnce, in whih parent class will more than one child class at a same level.
Ex:      G.F-> FATHER -> SON

3) Hierarchial Inheritence: It is a type of Inherietnce, in which one parent class will have more than one child at a same level.
Ex:      MOTHER
     SON       DAUGHTER

4) Multiple Inheritence: It is a type of Inherietnce, in which child class will have more than one parent class at a same level.
Note:- Muiltple inheritence is not supported wrt to class in java(Due to ambiguity problem or ambufity error)

5) Hybrid iNheritence:- It is a combinition of more than one type of Inherietnce.
->  It is not supported in java
